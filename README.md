# MaxTrade
An experimental stock and options trading program I built from the ground up in Python.
Log into your Robinhood account with secure authentication and easily view your positions, as well as your profit, equity, percent change, and many other data points. 
For the trading bot, you can set stop loss or take profit percentages for both your stocks and specific options contracts. Simply select the desired item, the quantity, and the percentages that you want to automatically sell at. Now you no longer have to constantly check prices and can prevent yourself from being too greedy (or falling into a sunk cost fallacy).

Disclaimer: I make no claims of responisibility if something goes wrong. Please treat this as an experimental tool, but it's open source, so feel free to build on it.
